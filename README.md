# tf2-adblock
## What is it?
A simple program made for blocking ads that appear in the MoTD of any Source game (or any other game that also has Pinion, MOTDgd, Unikrn, etc. appear elsewhere).

## How does it work?
By editing the *hosts* file and injecting code into it that'll prevent your computer from reaching certain websites, such as http://pinion.gg, resulting in no Ads popping up in the MOTD or in the background.

### If I don't like the changes and want my hosts file to be back the way it was before, is there a file for that?
Of course! There's another file in each OS directory that named something of "reset hosts".

## Which Operating Systems (OS for short) are currently supported?
Linux and Windows, currently!

Mac isn't supported yet due to the lack of having a Mac computer myself; but any gained support for Mac is very much appreciated!

## Are there any special requirements for this?
None at all, besides requiring Administrator privileges to inject the code.

## But why though?
~~why not?~~

Because with having played TF2 often, I got really annoyed at the Ads that would suddenly pop-up in the MOTD or that would start playing music/videos in the background.
