# tf2-adblock
## What is it?
A simple program made for blocking ads that appear in the MoTD of any Source game.

## How does it work?
By editing the *hosts* file and adding code into it that'll prevent your computer from reaching certain websites, such as http://pinion.gg, resulting in no Ads popping up in the MOTD or in the background.

## Which Operating Systems (OS for short) are currently supported?
Linux and Windows!
Mac isn't supported yet due to the lack of having a Mac computer myself; but any gained support for Mac is very much appreciated!

## But why though?
~~why not?~~
Because with having played TF2 often, I got really annoyed at the Ads that would suddenly popup in the MOTD or that would start playing music/videos in the background.
